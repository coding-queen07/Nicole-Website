<h3><p>Juvenile Unit Tackles Youth Crime with Prevention and Support</p></h3>

As crime among youths has increased in the District of Columbias, DC Public Schools has partnered with the Metropolitan Police Department to launch the Juvenile Investigative Response Unit.
<br><br>
JIRU, a specialized unit within the MPD, is an initiative to target intervention and support services among DC’s youth. The unit has three core missions. The first mission is expanding outreach to previous juvenile offenders to prevent repeat offenses. Second, JIRU is investigating violent offenses connected to youth offenders. The third mission is detaining youth with unresolved legal obligations. Year to date, violent crime in DC has gone down by 26%, but 60% of carjacking arrests have been juveniles. In the 2023-24 school year, 2,000 juveniles were arrested, with the amount increasing each year. There has also been an increase of physical altercations happening in the schools, as well as an upward tick in juvenile suspects, according to authorities.
<br><br>
“Through this initiative, we are tackling the root causes of violence and ensuring that our youth have the support they need to succeed,” said Mayor Muriel Bowser. 
<br><br>
Authorities will use data-driven analysis to identify crime trends among juveniles, with the goal of intervening before crimes occur. Since Chief Pamela A. Smith assumed her role, MPD has significantly enhanced its use of data across all units, according to the Fiscal Year 2023 Performance Oversight Hearing. By tracking real-time crime, the department can follow offenses as they occur.
<br><br>
“Say we have four robberies in the area of Coolidge High School in Upper Northwest and they're all occurring after school hours, between like 2:30 and 4pm. Well, that's the kind of tracking and analysis that then this team will use to hone in on who those offenders might be,” said Thomas Lynch, a spokesperson for MPD.
<br><br>
Unlike traditional law enforcement models, JIRU emphasizes a preventative and supportive strategy to address juvenile crime. By pairing data analysis with intervention services, the unit aims to disrupt cycles of recidivism while supporting young people on their path toward rehabilitation.
<br><br>
JIRU’s approach includes conducting home visits as part of its efforts to engage directly with at-risk youth and their families. These visits allow officers and support personnel to understand the challenges young people face in their home environments, according to Smith. During these visits, officers may work alongside social workers and behavioral health professionals to ensure families receive necessary support and guidance.
<br><br>
“This isn’t just about preventing crime—it’s about empowering our youth to break free from the challenges holding them back and helping them achieve their full potential,” said Kyla Woods, a community engagement specialist for the National Urban Fellows Program.
<br><br>
The success of the JIRU initiative relies on the collaboration between DC agencies and community organizations in order to connect the youth to mentorship programs and structured activities. In addition to DCPS, the unit is working closely with the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Behavioral Health, the Child and Family Services Agency, the Department of Youth Habilitation Services, the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, and faith-based programs. These organizations are helping the unit address the root causes of juvenile crime by focusing on mental health support and educational opportunities throughout the community.
<br><br>
“This is a district-wide effort wherever juvenile offenses or issues occur. The unit ensures all touchpoints are connected, reducing gaps in the system,” said Dionne Bussey-Reeder, director of the Far Southeast Family Strengthening Collaborative. 
<br><br>
To ensure its effectiveness, officers selected to serve in JIRU will undergo training tailored to juvenile case management and data analysis to improve tracking. Responsibilities previously assigned to MPD’s absconders unit, such as monitoring juvenile offenders who escape from mandated facilities, are now integrated within JIRU.
<br><br>
“This reorganization allows us to focus resources more effectively and ensure consistent accountability across juvenile cases. Detectives are already familiar with this type of work, but JIRU will centralize these efforts to maximize impact,” said Lynch.
<br><br>
JIRU was created as a direct response to persistent concerns raised by members of the DC community, according to Lynch. The department will continually gather input through the ANC meetings and community interactions. To gauge the success of the program, MPD will closely monitor recidivism rates, along with the overall outcomes for juveniles who have been through the court system. The progress will take time to evaluate, but officials remain optimistic about the potential for a lasting impact. 
<br><br>
“All of us who are adults in this city should feel some type of burden to get ahead of this problem. we cannot criminalize our way out of dealing with our young people, and we need to afford them as much opportunity as possible to become productive members of the community,” said Lynch.
<br><br>
By exercising collaboration, accountability, and community support, JIRU has the potential to create a brighter future for the youth of DC.
