<h3><p>DC Public Schools Under Federal Investigation for Discrimination Against Students with Disabilities</p></h3>

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has launched an investigation into DC Public Schools following reports of discrimination against students with disabilities. DCPS holds the highest rate of complaints about special education than any other state or territory in the nation, according to the Department of Education. 
<br><br>
Announced on March 5, the investigation began when complaints from parents, advocacy groups, and educators surfaced, claiming that DCPS failed to provide Free Appropriate Public Education. FAPE is a component of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, mandated by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. FAPE ensures that students with disabilities receive educational services to meet their needs with no extra cost. It is intended to put students with disabilities on the same academic level as their peers. Section 504 prevents discrimination in federally funded programs.
<br><br>
“Families should not have to fight for basic services that are guaranteed under the law. These systemic failures – whether it’s delayed evaluations, inadequate staffing, or inaccessible buildings – place an unacceptable burden on children with disabilities,” said Maria Blaeur, Director of Programs and Outreach in Advocated for Justice in Education. 
<br><br>
Students with disabilities make up approximately 16% of the DCPS population of over 50,000 students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That means that 1 in 6 students has a disability.
<br><br>
The investigation is addressing a handful of issues, most of which were affected by staff cuts. The decreasing number of teachers and aides for students with disabilities has caused delays in testing for disabilities, creating and following through with Individualized Education Programs, and inadequate accommodations in schools. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, institutions must accommodate the needs of students with disabilities to ensure their access to educational programs is equal to their peers.  Deficiencies including improper infrastructure, like ramps, elevators, and accessible classrooms, hinder a students’ ability to participate in academic activities that take place in the classroom, as well as other school programs. 
<br><br>
OCR has noted that delayed evaluations for students with suspected disabilities can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention, which is critical to their academic success. Delays can exacerbate existing challenges and hinder development, according to the Council for Exceptional Children, an organization committed to bettering the success of children with disabilities.
<br><br>
“We have made significant investments to strengthen our special education programs, expand inclusive learning opportunities, and engage families as partners in their children’s success,” said Evan Lambert, the spokesperson for DCPS.
<br><br>
One issue that the investigation is not examining is the equity in behavioral consequences. Students with disabilities face higher rates of expulsion than their peers, according to the Office of the State Superintendent of Education Discipline Report for the 2023-24 school year.
<br><br>
“Students of color with disabilities or male identifying students with disabilities are also suspended and expelled at higher rate than their non-disabled peers, and/or their white peers, and/or their female peers,” said Elizabeth Tuckwiller, Associate Professor of Special Education and Disability Studies at The George Washington University. 
 <br><br>
This is a violation of the Equity in IDEA rule, which was first enacted in 1975 by President Gerald Ford as the All Handicapped Children Act. Congress reauthorized The Equity in IDEA rule in 2004. This rule tracks disciplinary actions, including expulsion and suspension, to identify disparities on race, gender, or disability status to examine whether certain groups face harsher disciplinary measures than others. School districts must find corrective actions if disparities are identified to ensure an equitable education. President Donald Trump has been attempting to eliminate IDEA since the beginning of his first term but has been unsuccessful.
<br><br>
Advocates argue that addressing these disparities requires a multifaceted approach, that includes increasing funding for special education programs, providing ongoing training for educators, and more compliance with federal laws. Community involvement, as well as collaborative efforts between federal and state agencies is essential to creating lasting solutions to address systemic issues. Without these changes, students with disabilities will continue to face significant barriers to accessing quality education. 
<br><br>
“States are going to have to step up a lot to address the issues that they have without the motivation that was provided by federal oversight,” said Tuckwiller.
<br><br>
DCPS is fully cooperating with the OCR investigation and remains dedicated to improving education for students with disabilities, according to Lambert.
