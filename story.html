<h3><p>DCPS Investigated for Club Discrimination Claims</p></h3>

<p>School District Officials are under investigation of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights for allegedly breaking students’ amendment rights. The Federal Agency launched the investigation after students were denied entry to the Empowerment Club, preventing them from joining the club.</p>
<br>

<p>“The concern here is restricting the membership for individuals if they do not identify as a Black woman. I think it can be beneficial for other students to take part in and be allies for their peers” said Theresa Le, a tutor working with students from Eastern High School.</p>
<br>
<p>The Empowerment Club is an interest group dedicated to building “confidence, leadership, and self-esteem” for Black girls  in first to fifth grade. The club's restrictions are a violation of a clause in the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to the Parents Defending Education. The clause ensures citizens of the state cannot be denied equal protection under the law, and Title VI prohibits federally funded activities and programs from facing discrimination based on race, color, and national origin. If DCPS is found to be in violation of these rights, legal action will be taken, according to Dale Rhines, the former program manager for OCR. PDE has now requested further investigations into school affinity groups across the nation, claiming that other schools may also be violating anti-discrimination laws through the bannings of identity-based clubs and programs.</p>
<br>
<p>“The mentioned Empowerment Club…was born out of a school-identified need to arrange support for students of color. As noted on the parental permission slip, the club and any others like it are open for all students to participate”  said Evan Lambert, the spokesperson for DCPS. </p>
<br>
<p>This is not the first time DCPS has been in heat over concerns of racial discrimination. In 2023 a complaint was sent to the school district’s attorney. It stated that Black students faced lower achievement levels and less challenging coursework, while their white peers had higher goals set by the school and their teachers, according to educatorJeff Schmidt, who had a daughter graduate from DCPS. President Trump’s executive order terminating DEI programs, caused DCPS educators to believe the issue reported by the PDE and other alleged forms of discrimination will be harder to resolve. Without these initiatives students from underrepresented backgrounds may lose critical resources created to support their development, argues the PDE.</p>
<br>
<p>“As these programs start to disappear, students are losing out on the benefits that these programs bring,” said Daniella Cregg, a substitute teacher who works for multiple schools in DCPS. </p>
<br>
<p>The club’s adviser, Danielle Imhoff, temporarily took time off from teaching at the school and is returning on Feb 10, but has not clarified why this break happened. Eastern High School’s principal, Steven Miller, has declined to comment. 
</p><br>
<p>A verdict has not yet been reached by the OCR, but the issue has sparked conversations about racial disparities in education within the DC community and nationwide.</p>
