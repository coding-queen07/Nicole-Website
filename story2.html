<h3><p>From Mentorship to Advocacy: Rebecca Aguilar's Journey to Making Journalism Accessible</p></h3>
<h4>December 21, 2023</h4>
Rebecca Aguilar, a seven-time Emmy Award-winning journalist, is dedicated to reshaping journalism into an accessible and inclusive profession while championing representation in the media industry. As the first Latina and woman of color to serve as president of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), Aguilar broke barriers and expanded the organization’s reach by establishing the first SPJ chapter in Puerto Rico. Her leadership continues to inspire others to take on impactful roles, including Ashanti Blaize-Hopkins, who became SPJ’s first Black president in 2023 after Aguilar encouraged her to run for vice president the previous year.<br><br>

“I think Rebecca is one of those people who is a role model to other journalists of color and other leaders of color who see what she has accomplished, and it makes them understand that it is possible,” Blaize-Hopkins said.<br><br>

Mentorship has always been central to Aguilar’s work. Before earning her Master’s degree in 2019 to begin teaching, she had already guided many aspiring journalists, including Emmy Award winner Ken Molestina. Her ability to inspire young professionals stems from her passion for advocating diversity and solid journalism.
<br><br>
“She’s really dedicated to helping young journalists get into the door, and just advocating for good, solid journalism and specifically for minorities,” Molestina said.
<br><br>
In response to industry-wide job cuts, Aguilar launched #CallingAllJournalists in February—a project aimed at connecting students and professionals with open media positions. Her initiative lists opportunities ranging from national news networks to small-town newspapers and television stations, reflecting her commitment to helping journalists find workplaces that align with their goals.
<br><br>
“I’m at the point in my career where I can help other journalists get work, whether they’ve been laid off, fired, or need to leave a toxic work environment. I can help them find their happy place,” Aguilar said.
<br><br>
Aguilar strongly believes in the power of local journalism. She emphasizes the importance of community papers, which she views as essential to cities for covering stories often overlooked by larger outlets.
<br><br>
“I literally think that community papers really are the root of many cities. Community papers cover the stories that other people just don’t cover,” Aguilar said.
<br><br>
Throughout her career, Aguilar has used her investigative reporting to expose injustices and bring about change. Her work led to the shutdown of a foster care center after the deaths of three children in separate foster homes. She also uncovered unethical plastic surgery testing on veterans at the Dallas VA Hospital.
<br><br>
“We need people who will find out the truth and not be afraid. We need people who, in my opinion, can really make a difference, create good change, and make an impact,” Aguilar said.
<br><br>
In 2007, Aguilar faced a career setback following her coverage of James Walton, a 70-year-old man who shot and killed alleged robbers. Her interview with Walton outside a gun shop drew controversy and led to her dismissal from Fox KDFW-TV. Though Aguilar lost her wrongful termination lawsuit, the experience became a defining moment in her career.
<br><br>
“That one (story) stands out the most obviously because of what it is, what it was, and what it means to her and her career,” Molestina reflected.
<br><br>
After 28 years in broadcast journalism, Aguilar has shifted her focus to print journalism and continues to advocate for diversity, mentorship, and community reporting. At 65, she remains active, proving that her commitment to the profession is as strong as ever.
<br><br>
“I should write a book, but I’m too busy,” Aguilar said.
