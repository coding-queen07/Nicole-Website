<h3><p>GWU’s Response to Escaped Suspect Sparks Debate</p></h3>

The George Washington Police Department (GWPD) was tasked with keeping students safe whilst sourcing out a manhunt.<br><br>
Faculty and students of The George Washington University (GWU) were directed to shelter in place after homicide suspect Christopher Haynes escaped from the GW Hospital on Sept. 6, 2023. 
“It was honestly very scary knowing that it was in an area that I was currently in,” said Teresa Seraphin, a freshman at GWU. <br><br>
GWU’s buses, known as vexes, still drove students between Foggy Bottom, the main campus, and the smaller Mount Vernon campus (MVC). Students on the MVC were advised to stay where they were and vex drivers refused to take students to Foggy Bottom when the shelter in place was first put into effect. The vexes normally pick students up on 23 St., where the GW Hospital is, but met on 1957 E. St. instead. 
“What’s interesting is they (the vex driver) didn’t check my ID when we got on,” Seraphin said.
GWU is attempting to change this policy, not just on the vex, but in academic and residential buildings as well.<br><br>
“We’re just encouraging folks to use their tap active cards and to implement no piggybacking. Otherwise, just keep your focus and awareness around you,” said Lieutenant McMillan, who is a subcontractor of the GWPD. <br><br>

GWPD updated students through text messages and emails. <br><br>
“They started sending out cryptic text messages that were hard to decipher. There was a period of time where they just stopped texting altogether … I think they handled the situation very well, but I think communication could’ve been a lot better.” Seraphin said. <br><br>
More criticism arose as classes continued about an hour and a half after the school was put into a shelter in place. <br><br>
“One of my friends was really worried since her professor didn’t cancel her lab … classes for that day should’ve been postponed or canceled,” said Ragdah Alhothali, a student at GWU.<br><br>
These critiques have caused some students to take matters of personal safety into their own hands.<br><br>
“I am trying to get my hands on pepper spray or a taser. If that’s not legal then I would get a whistle type thing or an alarm button. More safety measures are on me at all times,” Alhothali said. <br><br>
GWU has since provided students with resources they could access for mental health. Specialists from Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which is located on the Foggy Bottom campus, were sent to the MVC on Sept. 7. <br><br>
“What’s funny is that the guy (Haynes) was caught in Georgetown, which is closer to the Vern than Foggy, but I think the Vern is definitely a safer place to be.” Seraphin said.<br><br>
	Security has increased their patrols around Foggy Bottom as the community heals.
